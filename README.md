# 🧠 Defaulter Prediction System - SBI Hackathon Project

This project is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline built to **predict loan defaulters** using customer banking, credit bureau, and behavioral data. Developed as part of a **State Bank of India Hackathon**, the system uses a **meta-modeling ensemble** of neural networks and LightGBM to achieve high recall while balancing precision.

## 🧩 Model Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Date string conversions, encoding income bands
   - One-hot encoding for product/group types
   - Imputation: 0 for transaction fields, median for bureau/numeric
   - Drop high-null fields and sparse categories

2. **Modeling**
   - Neural Network (3 hidden layers, dropout, class weights)
   - LightGBM with balanced class weights
   - Meta-model: Logistic Regression trained on out-of-fold predictions
   - Threshold tuning based on Precision-Recall curve

3. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix + classification report
   - ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, recall per fold
